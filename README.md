Autoprocess is a Back Office module that take care of all the daily webshop routines automatically. Also some of the routines that everybody else tell's you is impossible to do automatically. It is in most cases a question of creating systematic ways to treat your orders, in order to make it possible to be done fully automatically. 

NOTE: this module is dependent on module https://github.com/michaelhjulskov/manageorderstatus

This module works like a robot. You tell autoprocess the criterias(filters) to search for, and what to do(actions) with the matching orders. And You can tell Autoprocess in which order You want it to run these processes. 

Intention is, to give manager more freetime, that can be spent either on the couch, on the bike or even better: use it to improve customer services.
